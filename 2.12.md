## Heuristics
- Brute force a solution
- Choose the average MMST (Suri's paper)
- Randomized algorithm (choose random MMST)
- Visualizer?

## Theory
- Show (1 + epsilon)-approximation with FPT 
  - blows up as epsilon gets small
- FPT exact algorithm? (No matter how horrendous)
  - Geordie thinks 1D is possible for FPT

## Miscellaneous
- Other graph problems on moving nodes we can generalize
  - Suri's paper has traveling salesman & matchings
  - We could try something silly/similar like k-paths? ...
- Non-euclidean surfaces
- Different metrics
  - Could be interesting with our heuristic models
  - Combine with the average computations as well
 
## How to randomly generate spanning trees on n vertices?

- See [Prufer sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pr%C3%BCfer_sequence)
- You can get a uniformly random distribution of trees by sampling n-2 length Prufer sequences at random
- Maybe edge weights can induce some other distribution on Prufer sequences which gives a distribution on spanning trees.
