## Heuristics
- Brute force a solution
- Choose the average MMST (Suri's paper)
- Randomized algorithm (choose random MMST)
- Visualizer?

## Theory
- Show (1 + epsilon)-approximation with FPT 
  - blows up as epsilon gets small
- FPT exact algorithm? (No matter how horrendous)
  - Geordie thinks 1D is possible for FPT

## Miscellaneous
- Other graph problems on moving nodes we can generalize
  - Suri's paper has traveling salesman & matchings
  - We could try something silly/similar like k-paths? ...
- Non-euclidean surfaces
- Different metrics
  - Could be interesting with our heuristic models
  - Combine with the average computations as well
