## Heuristics
- Brute force a solution
- Choose the average MMST (Suri's paper)
- Randomized algorithm (choose random MMST)
- Visualizer?

## Theory
- Show (1 + epsilon)-approximation with FPT 
  - blows up as epsilon gets small
- FPT exact algorithm? (No matter how horrendous)
  - Geordie thinks 1D is possible for FPT

## Miscellaneous
- Other graph problems on moving nodes we can generalize
  - Suri's paper has traveling salesman & matchings
  - We could try something silly/similar like k-paths? ...
- Non-euclidean surfaces
- Different metrics
  - Could be interesting with our heuristic models
  - Combine with the average computations as well
 
## How to randomly generate spanning trees on n vertices?

- See [Prufer sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pr%C3%BCfer_sequence)
- You can get a uniformly random distribution of trees by sampling n-2 length Prufer sequences at random
- Maybe edge weights can induce some other distribution on Prufer sequences which gives a distribution on spanning trees.

## Counting distinct trees on n vertices (speculative)
- n! trees on n vertices where left/right children matter.
- For each node that is a parent, regard left/right and right/left pairs of identical subtrees as the same.
- With O(n) parents we get a bound of n!/2^O(n)
- Fact check this ^^^

## Counting matchings
- Choose 2 in 2n, choose 2 in 2n-2, choosen 2 in 2n-4, etc
- {2n\choose 2}{2n-2\choose 2}\cdots{4\choose 2}{2\choose 2}
- (2n)^2(2n-2)^2(2n-4)^2\cdots 4^2 * 2^2
- (2n!) ^ 2
- However, these are ordered matchings, so mod out by (n/2)!
- (2n!) ^2 / (n/2)!
- Fact check this ^^^

## How can we do an exact algorithm that is better?
- One option is ILP
- Best known ILP algorithm is (log n)^O(n) * (m * log V)^O(1) due to Reis and Rothvoss
- ILP to minimize M
- Define M to be the max of M0 and M1 (the matching at time 0 and 1)
- M0 = \sum_{u,v\in V}^N c_{uv @ 0} \cdot x_{uv}
- M1 = \sum_{u,v\in V}^N c_{uv @ 1} \cdot x_{uv}
- Constraints for matchings: for all vertices u \in V
  - \sum_{v\in V} x_{uv} = 1
